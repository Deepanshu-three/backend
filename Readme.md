This is my learning of backend in web development


commit 1-
started the project.

commit 2-
done some project setup.

commit 3-
added prittier config.

Note:- the above was the basic setup of the projects.

commit 4-
connected db to the project. Used MongoDb database

things to remember:-
1. always use try and catch to connect database
2. always use async function to connect database.
3. never provide the connection url in the code, make a seprate .env file store the url there and use that to fetch url
4. try to keep your index.js or any other main file as short as possible.
